## Key Integration Points

### Automaton-Symbol Integration
The automaton minimizer integrates with the symbol system through the following interfaces:

1. **State-Symbol Mapping**: Each automaton state has a corresponding symbol in the registry
2. **Transition-Dependency Mapping**: State transitions map to component dependencies
3. **Optimization Feedback**: Symbol usage information feeds back to guide automaton minimization

### Component-Automaton Integration
Components are modeled as automaton subgraphs with the following characteristics:

1. **Component States**: Each component's functionality is represented as a set of states
2. **Interface Transitions**: Component interfaces are represented as state transitions
3. **Dependency Edges**: Dependencies between components are represented as transitions between subgraphs

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Symbol management (registry, resolution, versioning)
- Component loading (loading, unloading, reference counting)
- Automaton operations (creation, transitions, minimization)
- AST operations (creation, traversal, optimization)

### Integration Tests
- Diamond dependency resolution
- Component lifecycle (load, use, unload)
- Version conflict resolution
- Performance benchmarking

### System Tests
- Full toolchain integration
- Real-world application scenarios
- Stress testing (large component graphs)
- Resource usage profiling

## Evaluation Criteria

The implementation will be evaluated on the following metrics:

1. **Binary Size Reduction**: Measure the reduction in binary size compared to traditional linking
2. **Memory Efficiency**: Track peak memory usage during operation
3. **Load Time**: Measure the time to load components on demand
4. **Correctness**: Ensure all symbols are correctly resolved in all contexts
5. **Robustness**: Test with complex dependency graphs and version conflicts
