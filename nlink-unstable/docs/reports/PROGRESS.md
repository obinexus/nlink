# NexusLink: Phase 1 - Week 1 Progress Report

## Overview

This document summarizes the progress made during Week 1 of Phase 1 for the NexusLink project implementation. The focus of this week was on establishing the foundation for the project, including setting up the build infrastructure and implementing core symbol management components.

## Completed Tasks

### Project Structure and Build System

- [x] Created project directory structure following component-based architecture
- [x] Implemented CMake-based build system with support for testing
- [x] Set up code formatting configuration using clang-format
- [x] Configured Git hooks for pre-commit code quality checks
- [x] Created migration script to integrate POC code into the project structure

### Core Symbol Management

- [x] Implemented symbol registry with three-tier structure:
  - Global symbol table (for system-wide symbols)
  - Imported symbol table (for symbols required by components)
  - Exported symbol table (for symbols provided by components)
- [x] Implemented basic symbol resolution algorithm with priority-based selection
- [x] Added reference counting for usage tracking
- [x] Created unit tests for symbol management functionality

### Version Handling

- [x] Implemented semantic versioning parser and comparison utilities
- [x] Added version constraint checking with support for:
  - Exact version matching (`1.2.3`)
  - Compatible version ranges (`^1.2.3`, `~1.2.0`)
  - Comparison operators (`>`, `>=`, `<`, `<=`)
- [x] Integrated semver functionality with symbol resolution
- [x] Created unit tests for version parsing and comparison

## Pending Tasks

The following tasks from Week 1 are still in progress:

- [ ] Complete integration of the versioned symbol resolution with the three-tier registry
- [ ] Implement context-aware symbol resolution for handling diamond dependencies
- [ ] Enhance symbol usage tracking with version-specific metrics

## Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Files Migrated | 24 |
| New Files Created | 8 |
| Unit Tests | 2 |
| Integration Tests | 2 |
| Build Success | âœ“ |
| Test Pass Rate | 90% |

## Next Steps (Week 2)

For Week 2, we will focus on the component loading system:

1. Implement dynamic loading system
   - Handle registry implementation
   - Component loading and tracking
   - Reference counting for components

2. Develop component metadata system
   - JSON schema for metadata
   - Metadata parsing and validation
   - Resource metrics tracking

## Issues and Risks

- The integration between the automaton minimizer and the symbol system needs further refinement
- Test coverage for edge cases in version resolution is currently limited
- CMake configuration for cross-platform compatibility requires additional work

## Conclusion

Week 1 has established a solid foundation for the NexusLink project. The core symbol management and version handling components are operational, with a well-structured codebase that follows software engineering best practices. The migration of POC code into the unified project structure has been successful, enabling the team to leverage existing work while maintaining a clean architecture.
